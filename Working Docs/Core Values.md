# A Note to Readers/Coders/Contributors

You might notice that 4 of 5 'core values' of Proton are in a two-part
format, what matters of these four are the first halves, the second halves
merely serve as rule of thumb counterparts to their vague former halves.

As a coder/contributor to Proton, youâ€™re not expected to merely satisfy the
rule-of-thumb counterparts but push far past the very high standards of
excellence they set. There are thousands of super useful pieces of software
that never truly see the light of day due to a command-line, there are few and
far options in between for those who want to create a GUI (in python at least)
and you as a contributor are in a unique position to challenge the status-quo,
help a million other programers and the only way to do that (considering the
tried and tested competition) is put put out the very best work you can. If
these standards are hard and you can only manage 50 line of excellence, that
50 lines will be more welcome than 1000 lines of non-excellence.

And finally, as to the first core value about the capital 'P'. We are dead
serious. As hilarious as it sounds/reads, it is no joke.

- To provide a fast UI design - to be able to create a reasonably simple UI
(like the word 2019's opening page) in under 10 minutes.

- To provide a flexible design - to be able to create something as detailed as
Words document view.
