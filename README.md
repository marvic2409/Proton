# What is Proton?
	
Literally speaking, Proton is a reference to electron. What it promises to be?
A major upgrade.

So far, almost/all GUI libraries for python are limited in their capabilities,
clunky or surrounded by *terms and conditions (yes, your looking at PyQt)
and when they're not, they lack visual flair to build a good-looking UI. The
situation is dire - python is the 2nd most used language, its the language of
pass-time programmers (such as this author), it is home to a vast multitude
of highly flexible and powerful libraries, home to thousands of super-useful
utilities and is sadly consigned to the 'command-line' which is the most
basic, limiting (and frankly speaking, horrible) UI that exists. The 
command-line might be a programmer’s greatest friend but, it limits the reach
of any/every python creation to just 'the programming crowd' when it could be
used by so many more people.

But putting aside all of the justified outrage for a while, javascript faced a
similar problem, very useful but limited to webpages in browsers. Thank 
heavens, python isn't nearly as limited. But then some innovator had an issue
with being limited and created electronjs - a framework that allows the running
of a javascript program on a desktop environment (via a browser, duh),
javascript now unshackled has allowed for some great commercial/non-commercial
applications from vast enterprises/solo individuals to reach just about anyone
who has a Windows/Mac device. All thanks to electron(js).

Proton aims to do the same for python - unshackle it from the chains of the
command-line and allow it to soar disguised as an '.exe' file. (both of which,
as of now are only aims with nothing to back it up)

# Why use proton? (and not its tried-and-tested counterparts)

It is for 3 reasons that you should at least give Proton a chance - it is
unrestrained, much more so than its competitors, with no care whether you want
to improve, incorporate, use or sell it. It is visually flexible and nuanced.
Proton plans in some extent to leverage the full visual prowess of a browser
much like its inspiration - electronjs, placing its visual capabilities and
flexibility above its competition and thirdly, Proton will not/never be
clunky (this author would rather commit suicide that create something clunky).

You want to write a GUI, what are your options? Tinkter, PyQT, PySide, Kivy,
the BeeWare suit. What's the problem with them? On a whole, absolutely nothing,
individually, a lot!

Let's see, Tinkter looks like crap and is also near impossible to use (have
never seen it used at all), PyQT is wrapped up in conditions and/or commercial
licenses making impossible/undesirable to most part-time/open-source 
programmers, PySide is PyQt's cousin, though less restrictive, it is extremely
clunky (as in hard to use pain-in-the-ass for this author), kivy is good. It
works, it's not restrictive, almost a dream come true the first time you
discover it but then, you discover that there are issues when you plan to pull
of a decently good GUI (anything that requires more than 1 single screen), yes
you can pull it off but the only way (as of writing this) is a hackey and a
possibly glitchy one. Finally, the BeeWare suite. It holds high ambitions, much
higher than the promise Proton holds, it’s backed up by a sizeable community,
it's been around for quite a while; you would have heard of it during those
big, supposedly (and sometimes actually) important conferences but, it isn't
quite there, there isn't a fully functional BeeWare suite yet and neither is
the existing work easy to use.

With the current state of affairs, most may be content with a GUI framework
that works and looks reasonably good. Not everyone, not the few who want to
compare with the great consumer-facing companies, not those people who are
fed-up with opensource applications looking the crappiest, not you, not
any more. Proton, though as of now under construction, is for those of you who
believe that open-source can and should look good, that opensource can be much
easier and intuitive than it currently is.
